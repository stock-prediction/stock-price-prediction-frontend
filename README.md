# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

<h1>Summary of Stock Price Prediction</h1>
<p>Stock price prediction involves forecasting the future value of a stock based on historical data, market trends, and various influencing factors. It is widely used in financial markets to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions.There are two primary approaches to stock price prediction:</p>

<p>Fundamental Analysis – Evaluates a company's financial health, earnings, assets, and macroeconomic factors to determine its intrinsic value.</p>
<p>Technical Analysis – Uses historical price and volume data to identify patterns and trends that help predict future price movements.</p>
